I'm preparing to interview a guest on my podcast. Can you help me write some social media posts to promote the episode? I'll be posting on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Here's the conversation guide for our episode:

Here's an example of a previous interview. We prefer to focus on specific origin stories and techniques to reach mastery in chosen disciplines. Can you make it more like this one?

# The Craft Podcast – William Entriken

## Conversation Guide

These notes are to guide the conversation. We’ll focus on these topic areas and prioritize the blue questions, but we *won’t* ask every question like a Q&A. We’ll have a human conversation and skip or go deep based on (1) our own curiosity, (2) whatever you would like to share, and (3) our time limitations.

### Welcome – :00 - :05

* Dan – [Intro] Welcome to The Craft podcast, where we interview experts in various fields to learn about their disciplines and how they strive towards mastery. We love talking to people who are passionate enough to master something. We have each been asking curious questions of these craftspeople our whole lives, and want to share those conversations with others. You will love them all. Please be sure to subscribe to our channel and click the like button if you love our interviews! Let’s get right into it.
* Michael – [William’s BIO] Today we are joined by William Entriken. William is a total polymath. Where do I start? He’s a technologist, livestreamer, app developer, runs a healthcare training business, does boudoir photography, authored a science fiction novel and learned Mandarin Chinese fluently from scratch. He is best known in the world of blockchain as the lead author of ERC-721, the groundbreaking standard that laid the foundation for the NFTs we know today. His work has transformed the landscape of digital ownership and asset tokenization. Always eager to engage with the blockchain community, William regularly answers queries during the NFT/Web3 Community Service Hour he and Dan host on every Tuesday 6pm New York time (and we will share that link under the description so you can check it out and be part of it) and contributes actively to various question platforms. Today, we’re looking forward to delving into his journey, discussing the evolution and future of NFTs, and extracting some insights from his vast experience in the field. We’re honored to have William on the show. William, welcome to The Craft Podcast.

### Upbringing – Dan – :05 - 20

* Origin story:  What signs were there that young William would grow up to be such a polymath renaissance person?
* You have a list of [annual goals](https://phor.net/goals) you’ve been keeping since 2007. How did you start that practice? How has it evolved over time? What do you get out of it?
* Why did you learn Chinese?
* You're fluent in a great variety of technologies, having deployed code to the International Space Station, Apple App Store, and a host of blockchains. When you encounter a new technology or body of knowledge you decide to learn, what is your approach?

### Blockchain – Michael – :20 - :40

* I am very curious about the process of how you started drafting the ERC-721 standards. What was the motivation behind it at the time, and what were the main considerations that went into it, and did you know at the time that NFT would make such a big impact and become so popular afterwards?
* Even as an expert, there’s always more to learn and explore. Is there a particular aspect of blockchain or NFTs that currently piques your curiosity or is a subject of your current research?
* How do you envision the future of NFTs and digital assets? How will they change the way we interact with digital and physical goods?
* You have had a lot of achievements and a significant amount of work done in the past, and like what Dan has mentioned earlier, I also saw your goals in life on your website and they are well organized for each year. How do you stay focused and committed to your goals? And do you have any advice for folks who also wish to keep disciplined and consistent with setting goals and achieving them?

### Community building – Dan – :40 - :55

* How did you first get exposed to open source communities? What are your key principles for developing and engaging open source projects?
* You contribute to a lot of different projects, many of which seem unrelated but ultimately come together into a very unique and compelling profile. How do you decide what to do? What to spend time on?
* You and I co-host the Community Service Hour. What do you get out of that experience? How have you developed your livestreaming skills over time?

### Wrap Up – Michael – :55 - End

* You've had an incredibly accomplished career, but what still motivates or excites you today? Do you have any future goals or frontiers you want to continue pushing?
* We've covered so much in this interview. What else would you like to share or what key takeaways would you highlight for our listeners? How should folks follow you to hear about what you’re up to?
* [Outro] Our guest today has been William Entriken. Will, thanks for being part of The Craft. Thank you for listening to The Craft podcast.
