## Short Summary

Kevin Xu, technology strategist, investor, and founder of the newsletter Interconnected, joins The Craft Podcast. Kevin shares his diverse career background spanning open-source technology, politics, and his time at the White House, GitHub, PingCAP. We explore how he cultivates his curiosity and drive for continuous exploration, covering everything from career transitions, embracing challenges, how his newsletter Interconnected was born, his plans for Interconnected 2.0, and his thoughts on the role of AI in content creation.

## Summary

Kevin Xu, founder of Interconnected and a technology strategist and investor, reflects on his career journey in the Craft Podcast. Brought up mainly by a single mother, Kevin's freedom to learn nurtured his learning passion. He worked in renowned institutions like GitHub, Pink Hat, and the White House and transitioned between politics and the tech industry, driven by curiosity and the thrill of challenging himself in new fields. Inspired by the TV show "The West Wing" and Obama's presidential campaign, Kevin initially pursued a career in politics, before switching over to the booming tech industry. Stanford law school sparked his interest in technology where he learned to code. He later founded a newsletter focusing on the intersection of technology, business, and geopolitics, reflecting his unique background. Kevin's rich experiences, fuelled by his voracious reading habits, allow him to consistently generate fresh content for his newsletter. Career lows include a stint as a chatbot company founder, where technical challenges and his self-acknowledged lack of focus led to a painful exit. Kevin also discussed plans for a paid version of his interconnected newsletter, his investment partnership, and the limitless potential of public market investing. The speakers also debate the balance between natural abilities and honed skills in shaping one's career. Finally, the potential of AI in content creation, the process of writing, and Kevin's future content plans were discussed. Despite pondering a podcast, Kevin considers writing as a practice that amplifies his strength.

## Conversation Guide

These notes are to guide the conversation. Weâ€™ll focus on these topic areas and prioritize the _italicized questions_, but we wonâ€™t ask each question like a Q&A. Weâ€™ll have a human conversation and skip or go deep based on (1) our own curiosity, (2) whatever you would like to share, and (3) our time limitations.

### Welcome :00 - :05

[Dan] Welcome to The Craft podcast, where we interview experts in various fields to learn about their disciplines and how they strive towards mastery. We love talking to people who are passionate enough to master something. We have each been asking curious questions of these craftspeople our whole lives, and want to share those conversations with others. Letâ€™s get right into it.

[Michael] Our guest today is Kevin Xu. He's a technology strategist, investor, and founder of Interconnected, a popular newsletter that examines the intersections of tech, business, geopolitics, and US-Asia relations. Kevin's expertise spans various sectors including open source technology, AI, and blockchain. He has served in roles at GitHub, PingCAP, and the Obama White House. His insights into US-China tech dynamics are sought after by major media outlets. Weâ€™re thrilled to have Kevin on the show. Kevin, welcome to The Craft Podcast.

### Origins [Dan] -- :05 - :20

- You have a wide range of interests and you pursue them with excellence. _Were there any indications that young Kevin would grow up to do a wide variety of things instead of just being an expert in a single area?_
- What drives you to work? How did your childhood shape that part of you?
- You decided to pick up a computer science master's degree _during_ law school and _without_ a background in computer science. How on Earth did you come to that decision?

### Tech & China [Michael] -- :20 - :35

- _How did you come up with Interconnected? What was going on in your life that led you to start it?_
- What's the best insight you've had about the China tech scene? How did it come to you? What's your process for coming up with and writing new things?
- How do you stay up to date with the China tech scene when you're not in the country?

### Content Creation [Dan] -- :35 - :50

- Let's talk about your less successful or fulfilling content creation ventures. What has been a flub? How have you recovered?
- _Have you ever wanted to quit the newsletter? What kept you going?_
- What's the boldest topic you've addressed that makes you most proud?
- _Why should a newsletter and investing go together? How did you come up with that?_

### Wrap Up [Michael] -- :50 - 1:00

- Given your wide array of interests, how do you stay focused when pursuing mastery?
- We've covered so much in this interview. What else would you like to share or what key takeaways would you highlight for our listeners? _How should folks follow you to hear about what youâ€™re up to?_
