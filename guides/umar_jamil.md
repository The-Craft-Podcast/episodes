These notes are to guide the conversation. We’ll focus on these topic areas and prioritize the _italicized questions_, but we won’t ask each question like a Q&A. We’ll have a human conversation and skip or go deep based on (1) our own curiosity, (2) whatever you would like to share, and (3) our time limitations.
