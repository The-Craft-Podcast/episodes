These notes are to guide the conversation. We’ll focus on these topic areas and prioritize the _italicized questions_, but we won’t ask each question like a Q&A. We’ll have a human conversation and skip or go deep based on (1) our own curiosity, (2) whatever you would like to share, and (3) our time limitations.

## Conversation Guide

### Welcome :00 - :05

[Daniel] Welcome to The Craft podcast, where we interview experts in various fields to learn about their disciplines and how they strive towards mastery. We love talking to people who are passionate enough to master something. We have each been asking curious questions of these craftspeople our whole lives, and want to share those conversations with others. Let’s get right into it.

Today, we're joined by Umar Jamil. Umar is a software developer, AI engineer, entrepreneur, and a burgeoning YouTube creator. Growing up in a bustling Pakistani household in Italy and now based in China, Umar is uniquely multicultural, fluent in Italian, English, Urdu, and proficient in Mandarin. With a depth of software development, open source, and content creation experience, Umar has become one of the top machine learning educators on YouTube, breaking down the technical details of famous AI models, like LLama and Stable Diffusion. With is broad range of interests and experiences, Umar is a great example of a modern master. Umar, welcome to The Craft.
