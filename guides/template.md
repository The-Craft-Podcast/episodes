These notes are to guide the conversation. We’ll focus on these topic areas and prioritize the _italicized questions_, but we won’t ask each question like a Q&A. We’ll have a human conversation and skip or go deep based on (1) our own curiosity, (2) whatever you would like to share, and (3) our time limitations.

## Conversation Guide

### Welcome :00 - :05

[HOST] Welcome to The Craft podcast, where we interview experts in various fields to learn about their disciplines and how they strive towards mastery. We love talking to people who are passionate enough to master something. We have each been asking curious questions of these craftspeople our whole lives, and want to share those conversations with others. Let’s get right into it.
