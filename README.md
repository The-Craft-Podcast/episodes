# README

## What is it?

A monthly podcast where [Daniel Tedesco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieltedesco/) & [Michael Du](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhengyang-michael-du-23b030167/) interview experts in various fields to learn about their disciplines and how they strive toward mastery.

## Why?

We love talking to people who are passionate enough to master something. We’ve each been asking curious questions of these craftspeople our whole lives, and want to share those conversations with others. We have no business plan, expectations of a large following, or desire for this to be anything other than a personal project of passion.


## What’s the format?

A minimally-edited one-on-one audio interview (in the vein of [EconTalk](https://www.econtalk.org/) or [The Tim Ferriss Podcast](https://tim.blog/podcast/)). We prepare for 60-minute conversations, but we might go shorter or longer depending on the flow of the conversation. We ask for about 75 minutes of each interviewee’s time:

* 10 mins -- Unrecorded warm up and mic check
* 60 mins -- Recorded interview
* 5 mins -- Unrecorded debrief and sign-off

## Why trust that DT & Michael are going to see this through?

We each have a history of seeing through projects beyond professional life. DT has [built nonprofits like Global China Connection and two chapters of the World Economic Forum’s Global Shapers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieltedesco/), and he co-hosts a[ weekly livestream on blockchain topics](https://hour.gg) with 100 episodes. Michael runs a Mandarin-language Web3-focused [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24UPVUGS_9A9Wp2saWVwIw/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) with over 1k subscribers.


## What will we ask about?

We do a lot of prep research and **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">aim for a conversation rather than generic Q&A</span>**. For reference, here are some sample questions from the first episodes where Dan interviewed podcasters he admires:

* Can you share the story of starting your podcast?  _(I’ll kick off the question by first sharing why I think you’re a great interviewer and my experience with your podcast.)_
* Favorite interview experience? What made it great? _(I’ll first share my favorite episode of your podcast.)_
* Have you coached anyone on starting a podcast before? What’s your favorite piece of advice to give?
* Biggest interview pitfalls? Do you have any experience? How did you respond/change?
* What are the key jobs-to-be-done of creating an episode of your podcast?
